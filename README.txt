This is an useful python library for people who care about privacy, this library is useful to cipher and decipher text using 4 simple functions.

---------------------------------------
Available operations in ckret library:

1.syph() -----> cypherises the user input text
2.dsyph() -----> decypherises the user input text to plain text
3.ksyph() ------> cypherises the user input text with unique 6 digit security key
4.kdysph() -------> decypherises the text only when 6 digit security key is provided correctly

---------------------------------------

usecase example:

import ckret
x=input()
msg=ckret.syph(x)
print(msg)

u can change syph(),dsyph(),ksyph(),kdsyph() respectively depeding on your operation

note:
text ciphered using syph() can only be deciphered strictly by dsyph()
text ciphered using ksyph() can only be deciphered strictly by kdsyph()

note-2:
in version 1.0.0 there is no support for characters --> @,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,),! , kindly avoid using them in your sentence.
support for these charcaters will be added in next version (1.5.0)
